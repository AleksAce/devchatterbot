# DevChatter Chat Bot
This project is a place for us to have fun and build a chat bot together. It's currently just a console application, but may gets in own GUI for local execution. I'm open to ideas about where we want to take this project. We could run it somewhere on the cloud, and we could decide that it needs a web interface. Let me know [on-stream](https://www.twitch.tv/devchatter) what you want to do.
